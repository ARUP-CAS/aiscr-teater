### 1.0. About the thesaurus

The Thesaurus of Archaeological Terminology (TEATER) is an output of the associated activity “Subject entry map – a reference aid for the cataloguing of professional archaeological literature” financed from the Strategie AV21 research programme and the project Archaeological Information System of the Czech Republic (AIS CR; LM2015080) as one of the tools of the AIS CR infrastructure. The original impulse that initiated the creation of TEATER came from an effort to help the librarians in professional libraries with the cataloguing of archaeological literature and research activities. During the development of the database and the search application of the thesaurus, TEATER started to be extended also with respect to other groups of users. In contrast to physical archaeology terminology dictionaries, the entries in the thesaurus are not alphabetically sorted but grouped into hierarchically organised thematic units. The user thus needs not go through the whole thesaurus but only through the part of the content they are interested in. The authors have endeavoured to add as much reference information as possible from other web indexes, handbooks and encyclopaedic works. The entries are equipped with equivalents in all three languages used.

For librarians who work with archaeological literature, TEATER can serve as a reference tool that quickly provides information in the form of entries or other reference information during cataloguing or research work, a fact the users subsequently appreciate thanks to the better searchability of the literature in library catalogues. For students of (not only) first years of archaeology and the lay public interested in archaeology, TEATER brings the basic thematically arranged terminology with accompanying information.

The web application is available in a partially responsive regime and can also be used on mobile devices. The sorting of the twelve basic categories respects the deductive procedure in scientific work, when from the theory and various archaeological approaches (first category) questions and hypotheses arise, which field research (second category) and subsequent analyses of the data and finds (third category) try to answer. The fourth category provides the thesaurus with an interdisciplinary overlap ranging from geology to the study of religions. More archaeological categories follow (chronology, activity area, feature and structure, object, material), themselves followed by auxiliary-historical categories.

The use of the index by other institutions or services, which might utilise it in the description of professional literature or the artefacts, is planned in the future.

### 1.1. Application controls

TEATER is freely available to both individuals and institutions. No account needs to be established or client downloaded in order to use it. The title page of the search application contains the two basic functions by means of which the user can find and use the contents of the thesaurus: the **possibility of full-text searching for the entries** (“search”) and the **possibility of browsing the hierarchical structure of the entries by choosing one of the twelve basic categories** (“browse”).

By selecting one of the twelve basic categories, the user goes over to the main part of the application, where **all necessary information is displayed in three columns**. The sign “+” next to an entry means that the given term contains hierarchically subordinate terms on lower levels. The button with the TEATER logo returns the user to the title page.

The **left column** displays the level of the selected entry; the searched entry is emphasized in bold among other entries on the same level.

The **middle column** displays all reference information that is available for the entry, including the English and German terms.

The **right column** displays all the entries that are hierarchically subordinate to the selected entry, if available.

**Breadcrumb navigation** situated above the columns shows the user precisely where they find themselves in the structure of the thesaurus; it can also be used to go over to any higher level with a click of the mouse. The entry hierarchy helps users with research or user searches by automatically offering possibilities of narrowing (the query was too widely chosen and provided too many results) or broadening (the query was too narrowly chosen and has too few results) the query in the OPAC catalogue. The “Clear search” button returns the user to the title page. TEATER also uses the browser functions, including the “Back” button.

**Full-text search** includes the autocomplete function, which dynamically displays expected results while the user is writing, including whether the searched term is part of the thesaurus as an entry (“Categories”) or only in the reference information (“Metadata”). When more results are found, they can be displayed all at once (by pressing the Enter key or using the “Search” button) or one can be selected using the cursor. **The results are presented in two columns**: the left one displays results from entry headings, the right one results from the reference information. When searching for multiple-word phrases, the application primarily searches according to the first expression, with the “OR” operator set implicitly. If the user wants to restrict the results, they may use the “AND” operator to make the application search for both occurrences concurrently (the query “settlement AND demos” will display only entries in which both expressions appear concurrently), and possibly the “NOT” operator to exclude particular results that the user types after the operator (“settlement NOT demos” will search for all entries that contain the word settlement but not the word demos). The (\*) wildcard character can also be used; it provides all possible character combinations in the place of the wildcard.

Another functionality TEATER offers is the **possibility to export** data from the database in the .json format. The whole content of the database can be exported, as well as the individual entries. The button for the export of the whole database is situated next to the help and the language version selector; the individual entry export button is in the middle column with the reference information in the upper right area. Each entry has a _PURL_ assigned (situated under the entry’s heading), which can be used to acquire a link referring to it.

### 1.2. Language versions

TEATER’s content is available in three language versions – **Czech, English and German**. The user can switch between them using the icons in the upper right corner. TEATER is set up so as to search in all three languages. Thus, if you type “settlement” in the search field, the application will provide results even if the Czech or German version is selected. It will be results in the given language version (TEATER will not switch itself into the version of the query and, therefore, not supply results in English, nor will the autocomplete function offer English words); nevertheless, this function ensures the possibility of searching also for expressions from versions that are inactive at the moment.

The translations of terms in the reference information are always displayed in all three languages, the comment only in the selected version (if available), i.e., Czech comments in the Czech version, English comments in the English version, etc. Where duplicities cannot be avoided due to language specifics, because one and the same term denotes two different things and has no suitable synonym, its meaning is specified by appending the terms from the two other languages in parentheses behind it (for example „granary (špýchar/Speicher)“ and „“).

### 2.0. Introduction to the contents and structure

As regards the composition of the entries, the Thesaurus of Archaeological Terminology is a compromise between the modular structure of the index of the Archaeological Map of the Czech Republic (which is based on the principle of the smallest possible units and the possibility of their mutual combination) on the one hand and the non-flexible approach of the national librarian authorities on the other. The classification principle exercised when creating the thesaurus is subject to both the discipline of archaeology and the logic of scientific work. Therefore, for instance, all historical documents are classified as “objects” and, as such, categorised under the main branch No. 8, rather than the auxiliary historical disciplines of historiography or religious studies. Likewise, all natural-science analyses have been excluded from their parent disciplines (mostly categorised within the main branch No. 4) and united under the main branch No. 3 (Processing methods). Exceptions apply to entries belonging to art history and, at the same time, related to ethnic groups. The thesaurus contains entries concerning both general and classical archaeology.

The thesaurus also includes entries whose purpose is to structure the index rather than to provide reference information for the users. This is why their middle field is empty, containing no accompanying information such as language equivalents or comments.

### 2.1. Theory and approaches (1)

The first main branch in the logical structure of the database contains terms related to general and discipline (archaeological) starting points. It respects a scientific deductive approach, when based on certain starting points and the theory, the scientist forms questions and hypotheses concerning their research in order to examine them in the following steps of their work. The branch contains two main categories – entries concerning science in general, and the basic notions and approaches used in archaeology. General entries of science as such include notions (methods or approaches) that are used by several disciplines of science. This applies, for instance, to structuralism, which originally came into existence as a linguistic approach but later expanded to a wide range of science disciplines or scientific methods/procedures that are used in multiple disciplines (heuristics, analysis, etc.).

The part focused on archaeology contains the basic terms of archaeological theory (e.g., the types of archaeological sources) and also the sub-disciplines of archaeology, due to today’s wide range of specialisations. These are of two types: a) chronological, historical (early medieval archaeology, classical archaeology, etc.); b) thematic (environmental archaeology, mining archaeology, etc.).

### 2.2. Field methods (2)

The second main branch contains entries concerning the acquisition of data in the field. The structure of the branch corresponds to the modern conception of archaeological research and also includes entries that were previously categorised under archaeological prospection, which was regarded as a preparatory activity to the fieldwork itself. Today’s conception of non-destructive methods is that besides their prospection aspect, they can be carried out as research in itself. The branch is structured into three sub-branches based on the level of intervention in the archaeological context (non-destructive, less destructive and destructive methods).

### 2.3. Processing methods (3)

The third main branch contains terms that concern the processing of data and of the finds acquired through fieldwork (see the previous branch). The approach to the branch is holistic – it includes entries concerning classical archaeological activities (documentation, typology, dating) as well as entries related to the development of the natural sciences and informational technologies in the second half of the 20th century. This is why there are entries dealing with quantitative statistical data processing and entries on natural science expert opinions and analyses, often performed by specialists in the given disciplines. It also includes entries describing further processing of archaeological finds, including conservation-restoration methods and entries relating to two types of institutions that care for movable monuments (museums) and non-movable monuments (executive institutions or historic preservation departments).

This holistic approach was a priority when designing the structure of the branch, which is why it was preferred when including the individual analyses and expert opinions in this branch instead of their parent disciplines, otherwise categorised under the main branch No. 4.

### 2.4. Cross-border and related disciplines (4)

The fourth main branch provides the thesaurus with a basic interdisciplinary overlap necessary for the cataloguing of archaeological publications. It is divided into two main parts, the first unifying entries on cross-border disciplines (archaeobiology, ethnoarchaeology) and the second, more extensive, entries on related disciplines ranging from Earth sciences (geology) to the humanities (art history, religious studies). The following applies to the part containing entries on related disciplines:

a) the depth of their selection is smaller than with archaeological entries

b) the structuring is unified, with the same categories – (basic) sub-branches; subject; methods. An exception has been made for geology and the auxiliary historical disciplines, where the structure is subordinated to their (numerous) sub-disciplines.

c) entries concerning the individual natural science analyses were excluded from this branch and grouped together under branch No. 3 (Processing methods).

### 2.5. Chronology (5)

The fifth main branch contains entries concerning archaeological, historical and geological chronology. Archaeological chronology corresponds to the Central European region. Archaeological chronology contains also archaeological cultures. As for the geographic key to the selection of the cultures, all archaeological cultures from the area of Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia and the neighbouring countries were included, along with a selective sample from the region of Western Europe. The Balkans, Black Sea and south Russian regions could not be disregarded. This region was covered in more detail than Western Europe. The structure of a culturally geographic line contains: “civilization; cultural complex; culture; group” (ordered from the notion with the largest extent to the one with the smallest), although “groups” were usually not processed and if they were used, then only exceptionally. Where it was possible and traceable, the entries are assigned dating and, in the case of cultures, also geographic localisation. We must emphasize that both are approximate, aimed at providing the user with a general notion, rather than with data for further research.

Historiographical chronology differs from archaeological chronology both in structure and in geographic scope. While archaeology does not use written sources, for historiography, they represent the main (albeit not the only) type of sources. The two chronologies may have points in common (the Middle Ages), but they need to be distinguished.

Geological chronology is the third type of chronology contained in this branch.

### 2.6. Activity area (6)

The sixth and the seventh main branches are complementary, the sixth containing entries concerning areas, the seventh entries on the individual features and structures. The structure and, to a significant extent, also the content of both branches have been taken over from the index of the Archaeological Map of the Czech Republic (AMČR). The categorisation of both branches (and also of branch No. 8 – Objects) is based on the functional perspective. The division proceeds from Evžen Neustupný’s settlement area theory (NEUSTUPNÝ, Evžen, 2010. Teorie archeologie. Plzeň: Vydavatelství a nakladatelství Aleš Čeněk, pp. 150-151. ISBN 978-80-7380-244-8), which is opposed to an earlier theory using places of a point character (settlement, cemetery).

### 2.7. Feature and structure (7)

The seventh main branch groups features and structures that occur within the individual areas. Once again, the categorisation is based on the functional perspective.

### 2.8. Object (8)

The eighth main branch contains entries concerning objects. They are categorised based on their function (ecofacts, armour and weapons, dress components, jewellery), regardless of the material. The definitions have been taken over from Karel Sklenář’s dictionaries (only one has been made digitally accessible in the Digital Library so far – [link](https://ndk.cz/view/uuid:e920e180-321f-11e6-ae84-005056827e51?page=uuid:15d8b800-76c8-11e6-8644-001018b5eb5c), the remaining three parts are being prepared); the morphological typography has not. The only typology that has been quoted in approx. three cases concerned the function of the object, rather than its morphology (fitting). Each citation includes a link to the relevant pages from the terminology dictionary in case the user needed the morphological typology. These citations will be accompanied by a link to scanned copies made accessible within the framework of the contract on access to Works not Available on the Market.

### 2.9. Material (9)

Material specifications, originally situated in the category of features and objects, have been merged into this main category, which now includes all of them, for the sake of clarity and elimination of duplication.

### 2.10. Auxiliary-historical headings (10)

This branch contains alphabetically sorted entries pertaining to historically documented ethnic groups and polities. The geographic extent of the branch covers Europe including European parts of Russia, as the Turkic people living there often influenced the events in Europe. No longer existing ethnic groups and tribes have also been included. This concerns, for instance, individual Germanic tribes (Lombards, Franks, Saxons) that do not form any polity today and lost their primarily ethnic character already in the Early Middle Ages.

Other auxiliary-historical entries are included in this branch: a basic selection of historical-geographic regions and polities; ruling dynasties of the Middle Ages and Early Modern Era from the area of Central and Eastern Europe; battles and wars.

### 2.11. Professions and work activities (11)

The eleventh main branch contains entries concerning professions and work activities. They are grouped into several main activities (craft production, mining, etc.). Instead of having two main categories (one for professions, the other for activities), they are both merged one; the structuring entries are the activities, under which there are the individual professions as well as the entries related to the activities (e.g., entries such as “masons’ marks” or entries pertaining to jewellery techniques, etc.). This is true despite the fact that in the case of German historical terms for the crafts, the more important (and more easily searchable) is the term for the craftsmen rather than the name of the historical craft.

### 2.12. Society (12)

The branch groups entries concerning the social stratification (both general and particular), various types of law, legal institutes and social systems.
